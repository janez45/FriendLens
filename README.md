## Inspiration
We are Creating FriendLens to simplify sharing and reliving memories through automated photo sharing. The hustle of manually selecting photos from the gallery when anyone asks you to send them is tiring, and long, we made FriendLens effortless and seamless.

## What it does
FriendLens does the following:
It uses facial detection to identify people in photos and automatically share them with the right contacts - detects any motion blur and overexposure, removing any pics that contain such
It allows you to select a time period of photos you want to send (for example yesterday night's party or last week's New York trip)

Some other cool features:
- The app integrates with all the social media platforms, and it converts some goofy photos into stickers to use in social media
- The appâ€™s AI selects the best photo of the night and saves it as a core memory
- Event albums, celebration reminders, photo enhancement, themed albums(parties, vacations, etc.), and many more.

## How we built it
We built FriendLens as an Android app using Flutter and Dart for the UI and integrated a Python-based facial detection ML algorithm for the back end. We used Google Cloud for deployment.

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating the Python algorithm into Flutter, handling compatibility issues with packages, and exploring alternative solutions for seamless integration.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully creating an MVP of FriendLens within a tight timeframe and learning about app development, AI integration, and teamwork.

## What we learned
We gained experience in Flutter app development, Python integration, cloud deployment, and the importance of adapting to challenges.

## What's next for FriendLens
Exploring more advanced facial recognition techniques, refining the user experience, and expanding features like personalized photo recommendations and smart album creation.
